  "In this project, I developed the homepage component of a modern company website using React and TypeScript. Designed with a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture, the site features a user-friendly navigation experience with the implementation of the FloatingNavbar component. I organized core sections such as Landing, WhatWeDo, About, Team, and Contact into a modular structure, creating a maintainable and scalable codebase. Using the Tailwind CSS framework, I achieved a responsive and modern design. By applying component-based architecture principles, I developed reusable components that minimize code repetition.",
