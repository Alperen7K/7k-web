  "I played a pivotal role in designing and developing the Kapsül TYS project, a comprehensive digital platform designed to streamline the management processes of youth innovation teams preparing for national and international competitions such as Teknofest and TÜBİTAK. My responsibilities spanned the entire project lifecycle—from conceptualizing core features and defining database structures to shaping business logic and ensuring seamless frontend-backend integration. I actively contributed to database design considerations, API architecture, and overall system workflows, ensuring the project's scalability, security, and sustainability. My holistic approach to both technical development and business strategy helped establish a robust foundation, enabling the platform to function effectively and efficiently for its target audience.",
